## General description

Forecasting in energy markets is identified as one of the highest leverage contribution areas of Machine/Deep Learning toward transitioning to a renewable based electrical infrastructure. The general aim of this project was to forecast energy demands in Spain. Specifically, the main objective is to train different machine learning models that can reliably forecast electricity prince in Spain. We used and compared a baseline model through persistence algorithm, a random forest, a convolutional neural network, and a long short term memory model.

## 1_Data

-This folder contains the data obtained from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/nicholasjhana/energy-consumption-generation-prices-and-weather). The data was originally retrieved from publicly available datasets via a public portal for transmission service Operator (ENTSOE) and red electric Espa√±a (REE). The two datasets include electrical consumption, generation, pricing, and weather data for Spain. The energy dataset consisted of 29 variables with 35064 observations. The weather dataset consisted of 17 variables with 178000 observations. Following a feature selection, variables were merged and reduced to a total number of 20 with 35064 observations.
